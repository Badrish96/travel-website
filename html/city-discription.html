        <h2>The Maroon Bells</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Maroon Bells, two peaks of Elk Mountain, are the most photographed mountains in the world and with their majestic image reflected across the still waters of Maroon Lake, it’s no wonder.
            <br>The rising sun colors them golden, creating an unbelievably beautiful vista.

            A trip to Maroon Bells can turn into an incredible adventure for those who like high adrenaline thrills.
<br>The lake is only 12 miles from Aspen,and taking a trip there is something all visitors to Aspen make a point of doing.
<br>If you will be visiting during the summer, get ready for some steep hiking, rock climbing, ridgeline trekking in the high-country, or you can just take a hot air balloon and admire the scenery from bird’s-eye view.
<br>When you get back, rest your tired bones and indulge in a tasty raclette at Cloud Nine Alpine Bistro, which has a warm and inviting atmosphere.
<br>Once you’re there, take in the vista from the Sundeck, join the yoga crowd for some free exercises, play golf at the highest golf course in the country, or hit one of many bike or hiking trails.
<br>If you come on Sunday, you can oftentimes enjoy live bluegrass music concerts. Kids will love the climbing wall and the Eurobungy trampoline.
<br>The Silver Queen Gondola operates daily in the summer from June to September, and on weekends in May and October.
