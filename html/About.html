                Building a website is an exercise of willpower. The bells and whistles of the design
                <br>process are tempting to focus on, but compelling content is what makes a website
                <br>work for your business.

            <p>
                There are few pieces of content on your website that are more compelling than your mission,
                <br>vision, values, and team.
                <br> And all of these elements are typically found on the About page of your website.

            <p>
                Since About pages are creative and personal to you and your company, there are several ways to construct
                one, however, the process is generally the same.
                <br>So, let's create an About page one step by step.
                <br>A remarkable About page is genuine, approachable, and distinguished. It should give the visitor a
                glimpse into what working with you and your business might be like.
                <br>You can include personal interests, stories, and photos that convey the unique story of your business.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-content">
            <br>
            <p>
                Your About page can and will be more comprehensive than a single mission statement, but to draw people in,
                you need to succinctly state your goal in the industry upfront.
                <br>What is your business here to do?
                <br>Why should your website visitors care?
                <br>This information will give the reader something to remember about your company long after they leave
                your website.
